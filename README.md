# SURF'S UP CHALLENGE

## OVERVIEW OF ANALYSIS: 

The purpose of this analysis is to obtain temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu for our client, so he can determine whether opening an ice cream + surf shop would be sustainable.

## RESULTS:

Through analysis, we determined the following.

- AVERAGE TEMPERATURE: January = 71°F  vs June = 74°F
- MIN TEMPERATURE: January = 56°F vs June = 64°F
- MAX TEMPERATURE: January = 83°F vs June = 85°F

Temperatures were measured in the month of January on a total of 1517 occasions over several years. While temperature were measured on 1700 occasions in June over the same duration. 

## SUMMARY:

We can determine through our weather data investigation that opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii could be a great business opportunity. Overall, the average temperatures in January and June are fairly close with only 3°F difference. On examination, maximum temperatures were also close, with the only notable variance in the January results, with a minimum temperature of 56°F. 

Further queries to examine average rainfall and daylight during these months would also benefit our analysis. During winter months, like January, there could be an increase in rain and a decrease in sunlight which may impact the sustainability of a prospective surf shop.
